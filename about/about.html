            <p>Cookie Game is a clicker-type video game where the objective is simple: try to get as many points (cookies) as possible. Gaining points is easy, just click on the cookie. The shop is where upgrades and cosmetics are bought, and where you can attempt to solve the codes in the Redeem Code section. This game was inspired by the popular game Cookie Clicker. You can find <a id="cookie-clicker"href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker here</a>. All content is designed and created from scratch (Nothing was copied). That's all, have fun clicking!</p>
