# CookieGame
This project is a video game that is based on the popular app cookie clicker. It is built entirely from scratch and there was no tutorial followed, the code is entirely mine. App features a store to purchase upgrades, cosmetics to change the button from a plain old cookie, and a section where you can redeem a code. There is also a page of patch notes which holds the games history and changes. The about page includes some information as well as credits to make it easy to find what icons, images, and sounds were used.<br />
The game can be played at https://cookiegame.netlify.app/. <br />
